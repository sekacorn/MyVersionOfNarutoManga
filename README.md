Created  a C++  okay program in which objects dance out in the Main function


Fear not because Help is here,  ok that's another show but here we go 

[Running the Program]
=====================================================================================
Step 1) Make sure  that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system


Step 2) open a terminal for linux and apple show offs or command prompt for us regular people .
Step 3) bavigate to the directory  where these program files are located

Step 4) Compile the C++ files using the following command:


   $ g++ -o program Main.cpp NinjaCharacter.cpp OracleDatabaseConnection.cpp -lclntsh
   (Replace "program" with your whatever  executable name you may choose)
   
step 5) if the compilation is  successful, run the program using the following command:
   $ ./program
   (Replace "program" with the name you used in the previous step)


Step 6) if the program will display information about Naruto and Sasuke, and establish a database  connection. then Mission Accomplished mates time to chilling


Dont forget mates,
==================


advice from legendary  wise  Jiraiya.. well I am translating it for you well from his point of view that I can tell you to the best of my ability; from these books I have written.. I shall guide you through the path of mastery in obtaining the  necessary tools and harnessing the power of the program we will call Giant Ball Rasengen ok thats cheesy but fibne, 

a) seek the Oracle Instant Client libraries, hidden in the villages internet. Retrieve them and install them on yoursystem, you will need the to connnect to database connection.


b) You can choose to modify the OracleDatabaseConnection.cpp file. Infuse it with the correct details of your  database connection, just knuckle head boy adapts his tactics to to go past obstacles.

c) Align  environment  variables, so you can access the Oracle Instant Client libraries. Ensure that the paths are set correctly, like a skilled shinobi  going through life well you are alive you know this stuff. ups and downs

d) check out the finest of videos games or your version of R and R

or or you can use the makefile I made. remember to customise it though

=============================================================

Success is not necessary  all about guts and resourcefulness. But hey, unless you're an Uchiha, things won't come easy. For the rest of us regular people, it's about laying the groundwork and practicing the basics, like counting on our fingers to make sense of things <-- that can be give you confidence. After the confidence is gained things become automatic, like muscle memory. and then believing in yourself   granting u powers  called "confidence" and powers called  "motivation" to go beyond sitting around, eating ramen or playing games all day or whateve lazy things u do. Now, it's time to run this program and gain that self-confidence. Remember, "Counting fingers to know you calculations are on mark", can give you confidence after you check that math addes up its simple analogy but it applies. It can help and if you need to  outclass anyone who anyone needs to be outclassed. 


<-- words from a someone who has failed before and  yes I align myself with Arsene wenger. at least we won the Golden Premier League trophy, a feat that no one else can claim. Others only win the silver version, which is quite common. If they win Golden version we always say we won it first, for that extra bit of security. After all, who remembers the second guy who to pull off the same feat? That's how history and pepperidge farm remembers. Peace!
